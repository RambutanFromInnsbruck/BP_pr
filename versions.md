# Babylonian pandemonium
Babylonian pandemonium is an application that allows to work with hidden data: ciphers, metadata, stegonograms, etc. It's possible to encode and decode data.

## Ideas for implementation:
- Grand Prix cipher for grids from 2x2 to 36x36
- Caesar cipher with shift by ASCII table (symbols 33-126)
- Mathematical puzzle about remainders
- Modified DNA cipher (parser for decode and encode)

## _v.0.0.1_
## Features

- Menu Ciphers with submenus Encode and Decode (same functionality)
- Blank menu Stego
- Creating a new tab when one of the Help menu Ciphers is invoked
- Start window for Caesar cipher
- Grand Prix cipher window with almost full functionality
  - Number of words input validation
- Quit with Esc

## _v.0.0.2_
## Implementation plan

* [x] Blank menu Help (add menu call F1)
* [x] Fullscreen (call F11)
* [x] Rename menu Ciphers to Cryptography
* [x] Rename menu Stego to Steganography
* [ ] Numbering of tabs with the same name
* [x] Tabs closing button in window (for _v.0.0.3:_ add close button to tab)
* [ ] Pop-up menu for left-clicking on text widget to save to file
* [X] Text widget input validation
* [ ] Caesar cipher window with full functionality
